This is a perfect way to use a text file for your Unity.
If you build a project from Unity and you have a small value changes, try this one.

You put your text file in StreamingAssets, then have this scrip in your Assets/Scripts.
Make sure you match the name of File before using it.

Odd lines of the text file would be an explanation of its next line.
Even lines are the values you use in your code.
